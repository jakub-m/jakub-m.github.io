- communicate through documentation.

- Have a single document where you collect other documents related to the project. It can be either a parent page of those documents, or an index to other documents that you ever found useful. The rule of thumb should be: if you found a documetn useful, it should be linked to that page. Add one sentence description of what that linked document is about.

Examples of useless knowledge

- A bash snippet that is thrown somethere in a company wiki.
