**Mirroring**. Do not hold to assumptions, use mirroring to discover new information. Focus on the other person, active
listening. No battle of arguments. Extract more information by comparing notes, re-listening, sharing what you heard,
having people that only listen and take notes, having extra ears.

**Slow down.**
Three Voices: 
- "Late-Night, FM DJ Voice" - deep, soft, slow, reassuring, in control. Down-inflecting.
- Positive and playful - use most of the time, easy going, good-natured feeling. Smile when talking. Upward-inflection
  encourages engagement.
- Direct and assertive - use sparingly, almost never.

**Mirroring** - [isopraxism][mirror]. Repeat last threw words of the sentence.
