# Chapter 2: Mirroring

1. **Discover information**. Do not hold to assumptions, use mirroring to discover new information. Focus on the other person, active
listening. No battle of arguments. Extract more information by comparing notes, re-listening, sharing what you heard,
having people that only listen and take notes, having extra ears.

1. **Slow down.** Three Voices: 
    1. "Late-Night, FM DJ Voice" - deep, soft, slow, reassuring, in control. Down-inflecting.
    1. Positive and playful - use most of the time, easy going, good-natured feeling. Smile when talking. Upward-inflection
      encourages engagement.
    1. Direct and assertive - use sparingly, almost never.

1. **Mirroring** - [isopraxism][mirror]. Repeat last threw words of the sentence. Non-confronting mirroring:
    1. Use late-night FM DJ voice
    1. Start with "I'm sorry..."
    1. Mirror
    1. Silence, four seconds, let the mirroring kick in.
    1. Repeat.
1. Use skills to **reveal surprises**. 
1. Don't commit to **assumptions**, use them merely as hypotheses to be tested.
1. Negotiation as discovery and **not battle of arguments**
1. **Focus** on the other person
1. **Slow** it down.
1. **Smile**. Use different voices.
1. **Mirroring**.

# Chapter 3: Labeling

1. Separate people from their problem.
1. **Tactical empathy** - recognise perspective of counterpart and express that perspective. Understand and empathize
  with counterpart's point of view (don't agree, but empathize). "It seems like...", "It sounds like...", "It looks
  like...". Do not use "I" like in "I'm hearing that...".
1. Diffuse **negative dynamic** by mentioning it right away. "Look, I am an asshole". "I see you are scared". Label it
  and replace with positive communication.
1. **Clear the road before advertising the destination**. Label all the fears.
1. **Accusation audit.**. Disarm the counterpart. List all the negatives that counterpart could say about you. Don't
   deny negatives (don't "I don't want to sound like an asshole..."). 

# Chapter 4: No

1. "No" gives security, control, protection, autonomy. "No" slow things down. "No" is easier to say, and opens
conversation. 
1. Email magic, provoke "No", force conversation. "Have you given up on this project"?
1. Force conversation by intentionally mislabeling emotions, like "It seems like you want this project to fail".
1. Pushing to "Yes" makes people defensive. 

# Chapter 5: That's right

1. Script to get to "that's right": (i) pauses, silence, minimal encouragers ("yes", "OK", "I see"), (ii) mirroring,
   (iii) labeling, (iv) paraphrase, (v) summary = paraphrasing + labeling.
1. Not "you're right".

# Chapter 6: Bend reality

1. Never split the difference. Don't compromise in the middle.
1. Use deadlines. Know your counterpart deadline. Deadline cuts both ways (deal is over for both sides).
1. Leverage loss aversion. Make the counterpart see that the deal can be lost.
1. No deal is better than bad deal.
1. "Fair", how (not) to use
    1. No: "I just want this to be fair" - "Let's go back and see when I tread you unfair and I will try to fix it."
    1. No: "I want to give you a fair offer" - "Let's go though the offer and see evidence that supports that"
    1. Yes: "I want you to feel that you are treated fairly all the times. Stop me if you feel you are not". Or, confirm
       deal with "That's fair".
1. Discover what the other side is really buying (real motivations).
1. Bend their reality:
    1. **Anchor emotions**: "I have lousy offer for you, but I want to propose it to you before I go to someone else"
    1. Let the other side **anchor** number if you don't know the market value. Or throw **extreme anchor** yourself.
       Make the real offer look more reasonable.
    1. Establish **range**: "In X they pay between $100 and $200". Expect for the lower end.
    1. Use **non-monetary** terms, offer something worth to them but not that worth to you.
    1. Use **odd numbers**, $32,414 instead of $32,000.
    1. Surprise with a gift for **reciprocity**.

1. How to negotiate better salary:
    1. Be persistent to **non-monetary** terms, so you can trade those terms if they can't be met.
    1. Define terms for success at next position and metrics for raise.
    1. Spark interest in your success. "What does it take to be successful here?". Have unofficial mentor.

# Chapter 7: Calibrated questions

1. Use **calibrated questions**, give illusion of control:
    1. "How am I supposed to do that"?
    1. "How do I know that X"?
    1. Use **how** and **what**: How am I supposed to do that? What about it is important to you? How can I make it
       better for us? How can we solve this problem? What would you accomplish by leaving?
    1. Don't use **why** (it backfires, accusatory). Use **why** only to support change: "why would you ever change what
       you always did and try what I propose"?

# Chapter 8: Guarantee execution

1. "Yes" is nothing without "how" (**execution**).
1. If there are other **people involved**, identify them and guarantee they follow. "Is there anyone else that we need
   to get approval from"?
1. Three types of **yes**:
    1. Commitment,
    1. Confirmation,
    1. Counterfeit.
1. Confirm "yes" three times, use labeling or summarising "It seems there is hesitation in your voice", and calibrated
   questions: "how do we know we are off track?". Pay attention to **inconsistencies**, like body language.
1. The more "me" and "I", the less important the person is in the team.
1. **Humanize** yourself: "I am Joe, what's Joe discount"
