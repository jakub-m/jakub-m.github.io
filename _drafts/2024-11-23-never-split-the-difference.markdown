# Chapter 2: Mirroring

**Discover information**. Do not hold to assumptions, use mirroring to discover new information. Focus on the other person, active
listening. No battle of arguments. Extract more information by comparing notes, re-listening, sharing what you heard,
having people that only listen and take notes, having extra ears.

**Slow down.** Three Voices: 
- "Late-Night, FM DJ Voice" - deep, soft, slow, reassuring, in control. Down-inflecting.
- Positive and playful - use most of the time, easy going, good-natured feeling. Smile when talking. Upward-inflection
  encourages engagement.
- Direct and assertive - use sparingly, almost never.

**Mirroring** - [isopraxism][mirror]. Repeat last threw words of the sentence. Non-confronting mirroring:
1. Use late-night FM DJ voice
2. Start with "I'm sorry..."
3. Mirror
4. Silence, four seconds, let the mirroring kick in.
5. Repeat.

Key lessons:
- Use skills to **reveal surprises**. 
- Don't commit to **assumptions**, use them merely as hypotheses to be tested.
- Negotiation as discovery and **not battle of arguments**
- **Focus** on the other person
- **Slow** it down.
- **Smile**. Use different voices.
- **Mirroring**.

# Chapter 3: Labeling

- Separate people from their problem.

- **Tactical empathy** - recognise perspective of counterpart and express that perspective. Understand and empathize
  with counterpart's point of view (don't agree, but empathize). "It seems like...", "It sounds like...", "It looks
  like...". Do not use "I" like in "I'm hearing that...".

- Diffuse **negative dynamic** by mentioning it right away. "Look, I am an asshole". "I see you are scared". Label it
and replace with positive communication.

- **Clear the road before advertising the destination**. Label all the fears.

- **Accusation audit.**. Disarm the counterpart. List all the negatives that counterpart could say about you. Don't deny
  negatives (don't "I don't want to sound like an asshole..."). 

# Chapter 4: No.

- "No" gives security, control, protection, autonomy. "No" slow things down. "No" is easier to say, and opens
conversation. 

- Email magic, provoke "No", force conversation. "Have you given up on this project"?

- Force conversation by intentionally mislabeling emotions, like "It seems like you want this project to fail".

- Pushing to "Yes" makes people defensive.
