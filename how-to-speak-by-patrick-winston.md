Notes

How to start
    Do not start with a joke
    Start with a Promise - how will that affect the audience
    Write a menu
The big 4
    Cycle in on the material (psychology + probability)
    Verbal punctiation
        ...to indicate the audience when to get back on board
    Near miss
        Surrond the concept with related concepts to establish boundaries
    Ask rhetorical, answerable questions
Time and place
    Choose proper time - morning
    Well lit
    Make it full (even if small)
    Better flat room than theatre-like
Board
    Allows to draw!
    Make lists
    Target that you can point at
Overheads and Transparencies
    Overhead display - Do not read transparencies!
    Do not use pointers
    Have banners instead of paragraphs
    Add instead of uncover
Props
    Use them
Style
    Do not copy, but observe and adapt
    Ok to be eccentric
    Story. Distinguish lecture from a book
How to stop
    Do not thank the audience, but be sure you are sure your material was worthwhile
    Tell a joke
    Deliver your promise. Remind the one from the beginning
