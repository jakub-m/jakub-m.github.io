On early Boeing culture:

- _No one of us is smarter than all of us_ (p. 41)

- _In order to launch on-time a truly great airplane, we have the responsibility
to work together to (...) introduce an airplane that exceeds the expectations
(...). From day one: best dispatch (...), greatest appeal (...), user-friendly
and everything works_ (p. 44)

- _Boing created a group of early customers it called the "Gang of Eight" and
involved them in all design decisions_ (p. 44)

- _The only thing that will make me rip off your head and shit down your neck is
withholding information_ (p. 45) - Mulally, then project leader of 777.

On early and late 3M culture:

- _It had a culture of innovation that employees treasured. Official policy
allowed them to use 15 percent of their time on pet projects, and the tenets of
"the 3M Way" included generous funding for independent research_ (p. 101)

- _What's remarkable is how fast a culture can be torn apart_ (p. 102) - Art
Fry (inventor of post-its) on later 3M culture.


On how outsourcing hamstrings innovation:

- _parceling out [outsourcing] construction of the DC-10 had impoverished the
company while enriching its suppliers. (...). Design specifications actually
had to be more precise, because any omissions would lead to costly disputes
involving lawyers._ (p. 85)

- _Now when they needed a part at a last minute or had an idea for a process
improvement, it wasn't a call with a colleague; it was a negotiation with
lawyers, procurement-chain executives, human-resources representatives_ (p. 88)

On GE playbook, applied to 3M and later to later Boeing:

- _While reaching for financial glory, Boeing increasingly was ignoring the
basics of customer support._ (p. 66)

- _From 1994 to 2004, GE spent $75 billion, 56 percent of its free cash flow,
	on stock buybacks and dividends._ (p. 101)

- Boeing spent _$41.5 billion on stock buybacks from 2013 to 2018 - enough
capital to develop several all-new aircraft. (...) Almost 80 percent of the
free cash flow_ (p. 144)

- _It's systematic. It's culture. It's the fact that we have a senior
leadership team that understand very little about the business and yet are
driving us to certain objectives._ (p. 169) - on later Boing culture.

- About late Boing culture that was no longer dominated buy engineers: _It was
difficult for the safety culture to stop something. (...) Groupthink was
encouraged_ (p. 223)

- _Cultural negligence, incompetence, or corruption starts at the top_ (p. 236)


About flawed process of airplane certification, costs, and aviation business:

- _Southwest had flown dozens of jets on tens of thousands of flights without
inspecting them as required._. Finally, they found: _cracks in half dozen of
planes, including one crack that was four inches long._ (p. 125)

- _Paying for pilots, maintenance and cabin crews (...) comes to 20 percent of
airline operating budget - more than it spent on fuel_ (p. 137)

- Dreamliner: _[had] fewer of the issues with dry nose and throats after flights.
(Carbon fiber doesn't corrode like aluminium so humidity could be kept
 higher)._ (p. 104)

- FAA was called: _"the tombstone agency" because it only seemed to act swiftly when people were dead._ (p. 118)


Other:

- _In flying, the superior pilot uses superior judgement to avoid situations
that might require the use of superior skill!_ (p. 69)

- _Dogs have fleas, and engineers have human factors_ (p.142)

- _Strategy was no a lengthy action plan. It was the evolution of a central
idea though constantly changing circumstances._ (p. 97) - Welch on strategy
(from van Clausewitz).

- _If you weren't already in the business, would you enter it today?_ (p. 97)
